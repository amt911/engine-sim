# FINDINGS — engine-sim

> This is the repo's **non-obvious gotchas log**. `AGENTS.md` § *Start here* makes it
> mandatory reading before debugging or touching the build, and mandatory writing whenever you
> discover something that cost you time and **is not deducible from the code**.

## What goes here

An entry earns its place only if **all** of these hold:

- It cost real time to discover (a wrong path taken, a silent failure, a misleading error).
- It is **not** deducible by reading the code or the tests — a reader of the source would not
  infer it.
- It will bite again: it's a property of the stack, the environment or the tooling, not a
  one-off typo you already fixed.

Not here: how the architecture works (that's `AGENTS.md`), what a feature does (that's
`user-stories.md`), or a bug you fixed in the same change (that's the commit + its regression test).

## Format

One `###` entry per finding, newest first. Keep each to a few lines — a long entry means it
belongs in `AGENTS.md` instead.

```markdown
### <Short symptom, as you'd search for it>

**Symptom.** <What you actually saw — the error string, the wrong output, the hang.>
**Cause.** <The real mechanism, once known.>
**Fix / workaround.** <The command, flag or code change that resolves it.>
**Why it isn't obvious.** <Why the code doesn't tell you this.>

## Findings

### egui panics on a glyph the default font lacks (e.g. "→")

**Symptom.** A kittest test panics: `No glyph for "→" (U+2192) in Proportional ... Install a font that has it`.
**Cause.** epaint 0.37 panics (instead of drawing tofu) when a label contains a character missing from the bundled fonts; arrows and the like are missing, "·", "°", "²" are fine.
**Fix / workaround.** Use ASCII ("to", "->") in UI text; check labels in a kittest run, not only by eye.
**Why it isn't obvious.** The text is only laid out when that widget is drawn, so it only fails in the state that shows it (here: while a dyno sweep runs).

### `cargo llvm-cov` fails: "failed to find llvm-tools-preview"

**Symptom.** `cargo llvm-cov` asks for `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`; there is no rustup.
**Cause.** Rust comes from Arch's `rust` package, which ships no llvm-tools component.
**Fix / workaround.** Use the system LLVM (same major as `rustc -vV`): `LLVM_COV=/usr/bin/llvm-cov
LLVM_PROFDATA=/usr/bin/llvm-profdata`. `scripts/coverage.sh` sets them.
**Why it isn't obvious.** The error points at rustup, which is not installed here at all.

### egui 0.37: `App::ui` replaces `update`, `Panel::left` replaces `SidePanel`

**Symptom.** Examples online use `SidePanel::left(..).show(ctx, ..)` and `fn update(ctx, frame)`.
**Cause.** egui/eframe 0.37 renamed them: `eframe::App::ui(&mut self, ui, frame)`,
`egui::Panel::{left,right,top,bottom}(id).show(ui, ..)`, `CentralPanel::default().show(ui, ..)`;
`rect_stroke` takes a `StrokeKind`.
**Fix / workaround.** Read the registry source (`~/.cargo/registry/src/*/egui-0.37*/`), not old docs.
**Why it isn't obvious.** Most tutorials and model memory predate the rename.

### kittest: a labelled `Slider` matches two nodes

**Symptom.** `get_by_label("Spark advance …")` panics: "Found two or more nodes".
**Cause.** `Slider::text` labels both the slider and its value box.
**Fix / workaround.** `get_by_role_and_label(egui::accesskit::Role::Slider, label)`.
**Why it isn't obvious.** Buttons and checkboxes with the same API match exactly one node.
